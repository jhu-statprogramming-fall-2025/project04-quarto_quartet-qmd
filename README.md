## Show Me the Money! A Roadmap to Biomedical Grants 

### Welcome to our Project 4 repository!
This repo contains the project proposal, exploratory data analysis, and all source code for Show Me the Money!, an interactive dashboard that integrates NIH and NSF data to visualize the biomedical funding landscape from 2021 to 2025.

Our goal is to provide a clear and accessible resource that helps students, researchers, and institutions identify trends in funding by state, year, funding agency, and research topic, supporting a better understanding of current funding patterns.
